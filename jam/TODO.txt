------------- todo ------------------------------------

* emit trailer from the process loop, not from each call. If a call is missed that @'s trailer isnt emitted. Emit from each 'if @xxx' block after handling whatever words. Default catchall there already does an emit

* autofill table js variables presently hardcoded in header.html, but how to gridify a table easily? One single '@' with everything isnt ideal
	possibly '@html tablegrid xxx' helper tags within the table, examining the table's regular html tags, or both?
		use to gather info about required column sorting, in-place editing, data types, dropdown contents etc

* complete the add/update/delete (and fix hardcodd to always try to add new)

* grid, editgrid high level control js functions
	can we simplify the runTemplate/runAction/backButton functions? How about generating the hidden '_id' fields automatically, and delete confirmation?

* field validation. Server or client side?

* obfuscate dbname hidden input generated by the html trigger

* define pathnames somewhere (common.h?) for things like sys/...

* combine runJam and runAction (util.js) as they are basically the same thing

* combine all the html 'input' types into a single thing? We badly need variable ordering of args anyway...

------------- bugs ------------------------------------

* html button - runactions are ajax, subsequent whatevers need to wait for completion (see purchaseOrderForm.jam save button for eg)

@each crashes if you dont have a 'filter' clause and do have a 'order by' clause

@get cant handle: {{@get admin_user filter display_name = 'Tim Taylor'}} because of the space. 'Rockerbie' works fine. Fix singlequote handling in getword (and its variants)

@skip n/w

/sys/js/scratch.js is shared :-/

------------- done ------------------------------------
