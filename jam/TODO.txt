------------- immediate -------------------------------

SEQ_12_elementid only caters for one sequence. Need SEQ_1_12_elementid
Need adhoc db lookup for single table.field (use autocomplete ajax for an example of how)
Generally lookup actions (eg autocomplete) should return all fields. Either update existing by name or create hiddens)


------------- todo ------------------------------------

* {{@runaction <actionname>}} - to have access to all existing state, unlike js:runAction. What happens after?

* emit trailer from the process loop, not from each call. If a call is missed that @'s trailer isnt emitted. Emit from each 'if @xxx' block after handling whatever words. Default catchall there already does an emit

* autofill table js variables presently hardcoded in header.html, but how to gridify a table easily? One single '@' with everything isnt ideal
	possibly '@html tablegrid xxx' helper tags within the table, examining the table's regular html tags, or both?
		use to gather info about required column sorting, in-place editing, data types, dropdown contents etc

* complete the add/update/delete (and fix hardcodd to always try to add new)

* grid, editgrid high level control js functions
	can we simplify the runTemplate/runAction/backButton functions? How about generating the hidden '_id' fields automatically, and delete confirmation?

* field validation. Server or client side?

* obfuscate dbname hidden input generated by the html trigger

* define pathnames somewhere (common.h?) for things like sys/...

* combine runJam and runAction (util.js) as they are basically the same thing

* combine all the html 'input' types into a single thing? We badly need variable ordering of args anyway...

------------- bugs ------------------------------------

* html button - runactions are ajax, subsequent whatevers need to wait for completion (see purchaseOrderForm.jam save button for eg)

@each crashes if you dont have a 'filter' clause and do have a 'order by' clause

@get cant handle: {{@get admin_user filter display_name = 'Tim Taylor'}} because of the space. 'Rockerbie' works fine. Fix singlequote handling in getword (and its variants)

@skip n/w

/sys/js/scratch.js is shared :-/

------------- done ------------------------------------
