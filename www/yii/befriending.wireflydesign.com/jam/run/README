reminder_emails.jam -> also must cc to office (everything)
NB... adding menu items breaks user defined menus. Need to hang on to existing id's already allocated

../cgi/runjam.cgi /home/wireflydesign.com/domains/befriending.wireflydesign.com/dev/src/www/yii/befriending.wireflydesign.com/ run/cron

Referrer email to include date for 30 day expiry

YP and befriender archive flag values
	0 = active
	1 = counting down to archive by cron job
	2 = archived
	9 = hidden. eg: referral form started but not finalised (completing the referral will set archive to 0), or YP delete button pressed on maintain screen

BUG
	the last part of the @action is included in the initial run. Should not be run until called - see bugs/report.jam
