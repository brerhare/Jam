<b>RETURNS AND EXCHANGES</b>

Our first priority is to provide our customers with their perfect pair of shoes for their wedding or other important event . We make every effort to ensure you are happy with your purchase.
 All of our products are custom-made or made-to-order items. Since there is a great deal of time and expense invested in creating these products we cannot accept returns for a refund, but we will do what we can to overcome any problems you may have with your purchase.

We take every step possible to ensure we get the size right for you so that you will be happy with the fit. We will email you photos when the shoes are finished to get your approval before we post them. That way you can let us know if there are any changes to the design you want us to make before we send them out.
