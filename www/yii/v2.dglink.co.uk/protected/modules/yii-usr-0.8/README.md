Usr module
==========

Usr module is inspired by the popular Yii-user module but written from scratch. It provides basic user actions like:

* logging in and out,
* password recovery and reset if expired
* registration with optional email verification,
* viewing and updating a minimal user profile along with changing password

It's goal is to be easier to integrate into current projects by not requiring to modify existing user database table and model.
Only the UserIdentity class is used to provide all business logic by implementing few provided interfaces.

Key differences from yii-user:

* smaller codebase, easier to read/review
* use good password hashing
* no need to modify current tables and models
* bundled mailer class
* all basic features

Currently, there is no admin user managment provided and it is not planned. The reason for this is that the CRUDs vary much in every project and it should not be time-expensive to create another one for users utilizing interfaces implemented in UserIdentity for this module.
Actions provided by this module does not require any more authorization than checking if a user is logged in. An admin interface on the other hand requires to define auth items to check for access.

# Installation

Download and unpack in protected/modules.

Enable the module in the config/main.php file:

~~~php
return array(
    ......
    'modules'=>array(
        'usr'=>array(
               'userIdentityClass' => 'UserIdentity',
        ),
    ),
)
~~~

Requirements for the UserIdentity class are described in next chapter.

If your application is using path-format URLs with some customized URL rules, you may need to add
the following URLs in your application configuration in order to access UsrModule:

~~~php
'components'=>array(
    'urlManager'=>array(
        'urlFormat'=>'path',
        'rules'=>array(
            'usr/<action:(login|logout|reset|recovery|register|profile)>'=>'usr/default/<action>',
            ...other rules...
        ),
    )
)
~~~

See UsrModule.php file for full options reference.

# Identity interfaces 

To be able to use all features of the Usr module, the UserIdentity class must implement some or all of the following interfaces.

## Editable

This interface allows to create new identities (register) and update existing ones.

## Active/disabled and email verification

This interface allows:

* finding existing identities using one of its attributes.
* generating and verifying an activation key used to verify email and send a recovery link

Remember to invalidate the email if it changes in the save() method from the Editable interface.

## Password history

This interface allows password reset with optional tracking of used passwords. This allows to detect expired passwords and avoid reusing old passwords by users.

# User model example

A sample UserIdentity and corresponding User and UsedPassword classes along with database schema and migrations are provided respectively in the 'components', 'models', 'data' and 'migrations' folders.

They could be used as-is or modified to better suit a project.

# Diceware aka password generator

A simple implementation of a Diceware Passphrase generator is provided to aid users when they need to create a good, long but also easy to remember passphrase.

Read more at [the Diceware Passphrase homepage](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html).

# Customize

## Email templates

Set the _setPathViews_ and _setPathLayouts_ keys under the _mailerConfig_ module option.

## Registration/profile form

Altering the form is not currently possible. Ideas are welcome.

The whole module layout can be changed by setting the _layout_ module option.

## Translations

Feel free to send new and updated translations to the author.

# Usage scenarios

Varios scenarios can be created by enabling or disabling following features:

* registration
* email verification
* account activation

Implementing those scenarios require some logic outside the scope of this module.

## Public site

Users can register by themselves. Their accounts are activated instantly or after verifying email.

## Moderated site

Users can register, but to allow them to log in an administrator must activate their accounts manually, optionally assigning an authorization profile.
Email verification is optional and activation could trigger an email notification.

# Configuration for Twitter Bootstrap

If using the [bootstrap extension](http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/bootstrap), the following configuration may be used:

~~~
'usr' => array(
		'layout' => '//layouts/centered',
		'formClass'=>'bootstrap.widgets.TbActiveForm',
		'detailViewClass'=>'bootstrap.widgets.TbDetailView',
		'formCssClass'=>'form well',
		'alertCssClassPrefix'=>'alert alert-',
		'submitButtonCssClass'=>'btn btn-primary',
		// mail
		...mail config...
	),
~~~
