Checkbox
--------

Addons		(page, slider, tab, gallery, ...)
Plugins		(product, blog, event, booking, ailer, ticket)


Input
-----

Site Name
Plugin Sid
Database	(name, username, password)
Cart		(site-email, gateway-user, gateway-password)


Process
-------

Create skeleton frontend - softlinks to selected Addons
Create skeleton backend - menu options for selected Addons, jumpoffs for selected Plugins
Register Plugin jumpoff logins with the selected plugins


Notes
-----

Only softlink/register what is needed.
Although this way requires a subscript for each Addon/Plugin it can be used to retrofit new items to sites which pre-dated them. This has been a major source of unbudgetted work lately.
