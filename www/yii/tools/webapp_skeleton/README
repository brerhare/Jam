Based on yii 1.1.13

If using components/Controller.php generated by yiic tool, don't forget to change this line:
	public $layout='application.views.layouts.column1';
And change default layout file too, if it is used.

Note that the order of the model and component autoloading in the configuration file is important.
Both /components/UserIdentity.php and /backend/components/UserIdentity exist.
For the backend to take precedence over the frontend file of the same name, simply change the import order.
	'import'=>array(
		'application.models.*',
		'application.components.*',
		'backend.models.*',
		'backend.components.*',
	),
