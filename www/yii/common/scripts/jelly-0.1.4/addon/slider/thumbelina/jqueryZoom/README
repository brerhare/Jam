This is available from the jquery plugins site, however the latest version is at the author's site
	http://www.jacklmoore.com/zoom

Usage
-----
Include the jquery.zoom.js script. Thats the only file from the zip thats actually needed.

Look at the example here which shows some styling for it, and includes a nice hover-thumbnail-select-image montage.
